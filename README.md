# Tesi

1. Install TRex (libTRex2)

2. Run ./build.sh (if libCppRDFox is still not installed, manually install the one provided in ./lib/CppRDFox (SVN version 2762) into /usr/local/lib, plus the header RDFoxDataStore.h into usr/local/include/CppRDFox (actually, the script searches for the header into ./include anyway))
